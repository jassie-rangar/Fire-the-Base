1.) FIRE THE BASE: Starting code for any kind of Messaging App. Also provide the basic knowledge how to use Firebase for Authentication, Database and Storage for app.

2). Functionality used:
    Firebase.

3.) POD framework used (of Firebase):
    FirebaseAuth: 
    Used in app to Register New User as well as to log in the Current User.
    FirebaseDatabase:
    Used to store info of User into the Firebase's Database.
    FirebaseStorage:
    Used to store media of User into Firebase.
    
4.) Launching the project:
    First you have to install cocoapods in your Mac by opening the terminal and typing:
       -  "sudo gem install cocoapods" .
    Then you have to get in the directory of the project via terminal and type:
        -  "pod install" .
    After it is done close the terminal and open ".xcworkspace" file everytime you want to run the project.
    
5.) Basics of App:
    This app basically gives you overview on how to integrate Firebase into your app.
    Also it is build in such a way that it can also be used as starter code for any kind of Messaging app.
    On launching the app you will get Login/Register screen. After Logging/Registering a white tabbed screen will pop up with nothing but a Navbar with Logout option, Cureent User's Name and Profile Image, and a User Compose Button.
    On tapping on to User Compose button a new white tabbed screen will pop up with the info containing all the Users data present in FireBase Databas.
    Furthure the first white screen can be used up for messaging app in orer to create a more functional sort of thing if u want to.

6.) Enjoy the app and if you want to then you can use my work to build on something new. :)
